            <h1>Final Project</h1>
            <p>
                &emsp;This is a page dedicated to my final project for the semester. My final project was a tower defense game 
                where your taksed with defedning the core in the center of he screen from eneimes that appear outside of 
                view and move towards the core. You can use the core's turret and the shops towers to defend the core from 
                these enemies. The enemies will get harder over time though, so building up your defences with towers is 
                important.
            </p>
            <p>
                &emsp;The game starts at the start/splash screen, where there is a basic demo of the gameplay of the game in the 
                background. Pressing the start button throws you into the game, where the core's turret will shoot where your cursor 
                is aiming. Killing the enemies will make them drop money, which you can spend at the shop to place down towers to 
                helo with the defense. The difficulty is represented with the stars on the bottom left of the screen, and if you 
                survive for 3.5 minutes, you win! Take three hits from enemies however, and you'll get a game over. Either way, a 
                screen will pop up showing your stats, and allow you to press a button to try again from the start.
            </p>
